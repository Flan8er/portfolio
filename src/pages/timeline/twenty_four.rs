                            I finally had the opportunity to fully venture into freelance software development —
                            this marked the beginning of a goal I had worked so hard to achieve.
                            During the early stages of building a client base, I was still working full-time as a mechanical engineer.
                            But not long after, with a few contracts under my belt, I was able to take off like never before!"

                            a few indie game proof-of-concepts, web apps, and internal company tools.
                            I was finally able to operate wide open — exploring every avenue and scratching every itch.
                            I even returned to my roots as a mechanical engineer on one project, developing a full carbon fiber steering wheel."
